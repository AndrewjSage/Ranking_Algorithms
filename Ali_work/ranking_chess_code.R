# I will be doing most of the work in this file.
# Current questions and brainstorm:
# If I upload 52 weeks of data into the .csv, it will have about 400.000 observations.
# That's a lot, but I don't think I will have issues with working 
# with such a dataset.
# Should I do filtering by ELO? It depends on the task I assign. 
# What could be confounding variables?
